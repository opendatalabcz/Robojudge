This directory contains code used to analyze LLM answering results (`answer-evaluator`) and the results of this analysis (`llm-answer-results`).

It also contains various snippets and prototypes that were not used in the final app (`prototypes`). These files were not maintained further and will most likely contain bugs/errors. Use with caution.
